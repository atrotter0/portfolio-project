        <h3>Background.</h3>
        <p>I grew up in Washington state and moved to Bend, Oregon in 2001. I love all things digital, and I am passionate about programming and becoming a developer. I am an avid hiker, camper, gamer, and programmer. I recently moved to Portland, Oregon where I am enrolled at Epicodus to increase my skillset in web development.</p> 
        <h3>Experience.</h3>
        <p>Prior to taking the C# / React course at Epicodus, I worked as an Application Support Specialist at G5, a tech company in Bend that specializes in digital marketing. As an Application Support Specialist, I recreated, documented, and escalated technical issues impacting G5 applications to the engineering team. I also assisted with coding bug fixes and features for G5 applications, helped execute test plans during application deployments, and assisted with deploying and monitoring G5 applications.</p>
        <h3>Education.</h3>
        <p>While working at G5, I took classes through Central Oregon Community College and Oregon State University where I received an Associate of Computer Science degree. In my spare time, I enjoy creating web apps and coding tools to help with day-to-day activities.</p>
